Repeat the same scenario by using if-else-if statement instead of switch case. 

code:

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char grade = 'F';
        
        if (grade == 'A') {
            System.out.println("Excellent!");
        } else if (grade == 'D') {
            System.out.println("You passed");
        } else if (grade == 'F') {
            System.out.println("Better try again");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid grade");
        }

        System.out.println("Your grade is " + grade);
    }
}

Results : 


For A --- 
	Excellent!
	Your grade is A
For D ---
	You passed
	Your grade is D
For F ---
	Better try again
	Your grade is F
